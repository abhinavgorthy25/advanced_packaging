# Advanced Semiconductor Packaging

In this repository, we will look into the introduction of semiconductor packaging including various types based on applications. We will also explore the fabrication and manufacturing processes of these types, as well as reliability testing on the packages. Furthermore, we will simulate packaging and testing utilizing Ansys Electronics Tools. 


## Day - 1 Introduction to Semiconductor Packaging 

The process of fabrication of semiconductors will take place in a Foundry which is a huge factory with high end equipments and have clean rooms of classes 5/7/10 to 10,000 with protected environment. These are usually maintained by companies and Intel, TSMC, Samsung and Integrated Device manufacturers (IDMs) like Micron, SK Hynix. These have 12 -inch Si wafers that are diced and it is packaged and sent it to different suppliers.

The main purpose of packaging is to prepare a bare silicon for the real world whhere it helps in two main ascepts, the protection of semiconductor devices on a die and connection of die to other dies.

### Packaging Connections and different types 
The first or bottom layer is a system board with Printed Circuit Board (PCB) which connects to other parts or circuits to build an entire system. Next, there is another layer called carrier on which silicon die is placed. 

#### Types of Carriers

->   Leadframe, laminate. plastic, ceramic, organic RDL (redistribution layer), Silicon, Glass.  

#### Difference vs Substrate and Interposer 

Substrate: It is like a foundation where all the electrical and mechanical connections are made for ICs 

Interposer: Intermediate layer often made with silicon/organic materials that facilitates connections between chips using TSV (Through Silicon Vias) and TLVs (Through Laminate Vias).

There are different package technology and they are listed the figure below.

## Anatomy of Packages

There are three main packaging concepts 

#### Leadframe Packages

a) DIP (Dual In-line Package): Through-hole package with pins extending from the sides for PCB insertion.

b) QFN (Quad Flat No-lead): Surface-mount package with leads under the package for compact size and thermal performance.

c) Leadframe-CSP (Chip Scale Package): Compact chip-scale package using a leadframe and wire bonding.

d) Leadframe-QFP (: Gull-wing surface-mount package with leads on all four sides.

#### Laminate Packages

a) Wire bond PBGA (Plastic Ball Grid Arrays): Die connected to package substrate using gold wire bonds and mold compound.

b) Flip chip PBGA: Die is flipped and bonded directly to substrate using solder bumps and epoxy underfill.

c) PBGA: Plastic Ball Grid Array, a laminate-based surface-mount package with solder balls.

d) LGA: Land Grid Array with flat pads instead of solder balls, allowing socketed connections.

e) FC-CSP: Flip Chip Chip Scale Package combining flip-chip bonding and chip-scale size.

#### Advanced Package Substrates

a) 2D: Multiple dies placed side-by-side on a substrate.

b) 2.1D: 2D layout enhanced with a Redistribution Layer (RDL).

c) 2.3D: Dies mounted on an organic interposer for better routing.

d) 2.5D: Dies mounted on a silicon interposer for high-density interconnects.

e) 2.5D CoWoS (Latest - Chip on Wafer on Substrate): SoC and HBM stacked on silicon interposer over a substrate for high bandwidth and integration.
