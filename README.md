# Advanced Semiconductor Packaging

In this repository, we will look into the introduction of semiconductor packaging including various types based on applications. We will also explore the fabrication and manufacturing processes of these types, as well as reliability testing on the packages. Furthermore, we will simulate packaging and testing utilizing Ansys Electronics Tools.
